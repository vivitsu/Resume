\newline
\textbf{Software Development Engineer}, Amazon Web Services, Seattle, WA \hfill Jul 2016 - Present
\begin{itemize}
\item As part of the AWS SDKs and Tools team, I work on AWS' internal SDK release automation platform, which orchestrates daily release of all public AWS SDKs. In this team, I work closely with all the AWS SDK teams, and any service teams at AWS that release services in the public SDKs.
\item Improved our platform's notification capabilities by implementing a system that provides customers (AWS service teams) information about pending actions blocking a release.
\item Improved our platform's orchestration capabilities by allowing SDK teams to customize their packaging and publishing toolchain from our service.
\item Improved platform security by working with the AWS Application Security team to identify security risks in our service, and mitigating them. This work is currently ongoing
\item Improved platform reliability by leading an operational review of our service to identify monitoring, alarming, and availablity risks, and implementing mitigations. This work is currently ongoing.
\item Designed \& implemented a web publishing pipeline for the Amazon WorkDocs product blog using the Jekyll \& Ruby ecosystem. The website is published to Amazon S3, and served via AWS CloudFront.
\item Implemented multiple collaboration features for the Amazon WorkDocs web client, and as part of a team, implemented a redesign of the web client. This included writing new components for major parts of the web client, including the account panel and profile page.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Software Engineer}, LendingHome, San Francisco, CA \hfill Feb 2015 - Jul 2016
\begin{itemize}
\item Designed \& implemented a framework to schedule data pipelines using \textbf{Celery}, an asynchronous, concurrent task queue. Using this framework, we were able to improve performance of our existing pipelines by more than 100\%.
\item Developed \& maintained a web service using \textbf{Flask}, \textbf{uWSGI} \& \textbf{Tesseract} to automatically perform OCR on documents that are uploaded to the platform. The OCR-ed documents are then annotated by underwriters \& auditors to speed up loan processing.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Software Engineer}, Applied Intelligence, IO Data Centers, San Francisco, CA \hfill Sep 2014 - Feb 2015
\begin{itemize}
    \item Developed data processing pipelines using \textbf{Apache Pig} to analyze sensor data that monitors the power characteristics of a datacenter. The goal was to identify ooportunities for automating workflows that would reduce overall power consumption.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Embedded Engineer}, Volansys Technologies, Ahmedabad, India \hfill November 2011 - July 2012
\begin{itemize}
\item Developed \& maintained a \textbf{USB 2.0 (EHCI)} driver, to allow clients on a LAN to boot using an USB to Ethenet adapter.
\item Developed components to interface with the \textbf{PCI} \& \textbf{BIOS} subsystems in order to manage the complete \textbf{state machine} of the host controller \& maintain driver compatibility with adapters from multiple vendors. 
\end{itemize}
