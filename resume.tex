\MakeUppercase{\bf Projects}
\smallskip
\hrule
%---------------------
%	PROJECT - 1
%---------------------
{\bf Web Server for Location Based Applications}\hfill{February 2013 - April 2013}\\
Designed and implemented a highly concurrent \& secure web server that serves the client with different resources after accepting it's location. The server also had features for user account creation and user history. Used Go \& Redis.\medskip \\
%---------------------
%	PROJECT - 2
%---------------------
{\bf Face Recognition using Artificial Neural Networks}\hfill{February 2013 - April 2013}\\
Designed and implemented an application that performed face recognition using an artificial neural network on a CPU\slash GPU cluster. Principal Component Analysis was used for feature extraction and error backpropagation was used to train the network. Used CUDA \& C. \medskip \\
%---------------------
%	PROJECT - 3
%---------------------
{\bf Distributed Fault-Tolerant Stock Exchange System}\hfill{April 2013}\\
Implemented a fault-tolerant stock exchange system using reliable multicasting \& virtual synchrony that preserved client \& stock data across multiple nodes \& traded stocks based on orders received from multiple clients connected to different nodes. Used the JGroups toolkit \& Java.\medskip \\
%---------------------
%	PROJECT - 4
%---------------------
{\bf Distributed Control of Currency Exchange Value}\hfill{March 2013}\\
Implemented totally-ordered multicasting using Lamport’s logical clocks. The goal was to keep the replicas on the 3 machines, which shared a currency exchange value, consistent using active replication protocol. Used Java multi-threading and socket programming APIs.\medskip \\
%---------------------
%	PROJECT - 5
%---------------------
{\bf DNS Server using Java RMI}\hfill{February 2013}\\
Implemented a DNS server that supports recursive as well as iterative name resolution with support for server side caching using Java RMI.\medskip \\
%---------------------
%	PROJECT - 6
%---------------------
{\bf Topology Management in Peer-to-Peer Systems}\hfill{January 2013}\\
Implemented the T-Man gossip based topology management protocol for peer to peer overlay networks, which achieved various topologies for a cluster of nodes based on different distance functions. Used C.\medskip \\
%---------------------
%	PROJECT - 7
%---------------------
{\bf Simulation of Dijkstra's Algorithm}\hfill{July 2010 - November 2010}\\
Developed a program in C that would take a user-defined network graph as input and find the shortest path between any two nodes in the graph using Dijkstra’s algorithm.\medskip \\
%-----------------------------
%	PRESENTATION - 1
%-----------------------------
{\bf ``Fundamentals of Switching \& Mobile Number Portability in a GSM network''}\hfill{April 2011}\\
Prepared and presented a report on the operation of a large scale GSM network, including switching principles and mobile number portability implementation. \medskip \\
