\newline
\textbf{Software Development Engineer}, Amazon Web Services, Seattle, WA \hfill Jul 2016 - Present
\begin{itemize}
\item Software Engineer on AWS' internal SDK release automation platform, responsible for orchestrating SDK release workflows, which include linting and validating AWS service models, release schedule management, ensuring compliance with AWS API guidelines and AWS launch requirements, e.g. CloudFormation integration. Responsibilities include collaborating with SDK and service teams on new requirements and workflow and orchestration improvements.
\item Significantly improved the platform notification layer, to communicate upcoming launch deadlines, reviewer churn, and enforce that launch action items are complete, e.g. testing new SDK versions before release. 
\item Improved integration with SDK build systems by building a metadata specification API, using which SDK teams can customize their build systems, e.g. specify branches related to specific service builds in SDK codegen repos, service specific configuration for individual SDKs, e.g., PowerShell, etc.
\item Improved our authorization model to ensure service and SDK teams have the correct access when managing team-specific activities related to their SDK launch.
\item Contributed to our team's annual operational planning exercise, outlining opportunities, goals, and plans for improving the value provided by our service to AWS in the coming years.
\item Idenitified bottlenecks in our service's day-to-day operations, and contributed to goals for reducing the operational load and oncall activities for the service.
\item Led the security and operation readiness review for our service, which includes classifying all known architectural and operational security, latency and availability risks, and coming up with a plan to mitigate them. 
\item Designed \& implemented a web publishing pipeline for the Amazon WorkDocs product blog using the Jekyll framework - https://blog.amazonworkdocs.com/.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Software Engineer}, LendingHome, San Francisco, CA \hfill Feb 2015 - Jul 2016
\begin{itemize}
\item Designed \& implemented a framework to schedule data pipelines using \textbf{Celery}, an asynchronous, concurrent task queue. Using this framework, we were able to improve performance of our existing pipelines by more than 100\%.
\item Developed \& maintained a web service using \textbf{Flask}, \textbf{uWSGI} \& \textbf{Tesseract} to automatically perform OCR on documents that are uploaded to the platform. The OCR-ed documents are then annotated by underwriters \& auditors to speed up loan processing.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Software Engineer}, Applied Intelligence, IO Data Centers, San Francisco, CA \hfill Sep 2014 - Feb 2015
\begin{itemize}
\item Developed data processing pipelines using \textbf{Apache Pig} to analyze sensor data that monitors the power characteristics of a datacenter. The goal was to identify ooportunities for automating workflows that would reduce overall power consumption.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Embedded Engineer}, Volansys Technologies, Ahmedabad, India \hfill November 2011 - July 2012
\begin{itemize}
\item Developed \& maintained a \textbf{USB 2.0 (EHCI)} driver, to allow clients on a LAN to boot using an USB to Ethenet adapter, including interfacing with the \textbf{PCI} \& \textbf{BIOS} subsystems in order to manage the host controller \textbf{state machine} \& maintain driver compatibility with adapters from multiple vendors. 
\end{itemize}
