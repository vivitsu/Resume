{\bf Advanced Computing \& Information Systems Lab}, University of Florida \hfill May 2013 - Present\\
\textit{Research Volunteer}
\begin{itemize}
%---------------------
%	PROJECT - 1
%---------------------
    \item Developed a Java application that fetches JSON objects from a URL and adds them to Riak. Bucket creation, key management \& interfacing with Riak are all managed by the application. %\smallskip \\
    \item Working on the implementation, evaluation \& tuning of text-based information retrieval systems using Hadoop \& Riak.% \smallskip \\
\end{itemize}
{\bf Volansys Technologies}, Ahmedabad, India\hfill November 2011 - July 2012\\
\textit{Embedded Engineer}
\begin{itemize}
%---------------------
%	PROJECT - 1
%---------------------
    \item Developed a USB 2.0 (Enhanced Host Controller Interface) Host Controller driver in x86 assembly, as part of an application which allowed clients to PXE (Pre-boot eXecution Environment) boot via a network using an USB to Ethenet adapter. %\smallskip \\
    \item Developed software components to manage the PCI bus, negotiate ownership with the BIOS subsystem and added support for multiple vendor adapters, as part of the overall PXE application. %\smallskip \\
%Handled responsibility for all aspects of the project, including development, maintenance, documentation \& client interaction.\smallskip \\
%---------------------
%	PROJECT - 2
%---------------------
    \item Worked with a team of 2 engineers to develop a software feature that would allow multiple broadcast domains in a wireless router to form a VLAN (Virtual LAN). The wireless router was based on the MIPS \& VxWorks platforms.

%	PROJECT - 1
%---------------------
{\bf Web Service for Location Based Applications} \hfill February 2013 - April 2013
\begin{itemize}
    \item Designed and implemented a secure web application in Go that allows a user to view different resources on the web about his location, including Wikipedia links if the user is at a well-known point of interest.
    \item Created a custom Redis datastore that stored a user's account details, his location history \& a POI database.
    \item Project source code can be found at https://bitbucket.org/vivitsu/goserve.
\end{itemize}
%---------------------
%	PROJECT - 2
%---------------------
%{\bf Face Recognition using Artificial Neural Networks} \textit{using C \& CUDA}\hfill{\bf February 2013 - April 2013} \smallskip \\
%Designed and implemented an application that performed face recognition using an artificial neural network on a CPU/GPU cluster. \smallskip
%Used Principal Component Analysis for feature extraction and error backpropagation to train the network. %\medskip

%---------------------
%	PROJECT - 3
%---------------------
{\bf Distributed Fault-Tolerant Stock Exchange System} \hfill April 2013
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implemented a stock exchange system using Java \& JGroups that used fault-tolerant, virtually synchronous replicas to perform stock trades.
    \item The system was designed to handle large number of client connections \& trade requests to different nodes in the system.
    \item Client information, trade requests \& stock data are preserved by the system. %\medskip
\end{itemize}
%---------------------
%	PROJECT - 4
%---------------------
{\bf Gossip based Topology Management in Peer-to-Peer Systems} \hfill January 2013, August 2013
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implemented the T-Man gossip based topology management protocol for peer to peer overlay networks using C, which achieved various topologies for a cluster of nodes based on different distance functions.
    \item Modified the T-Man implementation so that it would adapt it's topology at runtime to changes in the radius of the network. This implementation was done in Java. %\medskip
\end{itemize}
%---------------------
%	PROJECT - 5
%---------------------
%{\bf DNS Server} \textit{using Java RMI}\hfill{\bf February 2013} \smallskip \\
%Implemented a DNS server that supports recursive as well as iterative name resolution with support for server side caching using Java RMI. %\medskip

%---------------------
%	PROJECT - 6
%---------------------
{\bf Distributed Control of Currency Exchange Value} \hfill March 2013
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implemented totally-ordered multicasting in Java using Lamport's logical clocks. The goal was to keep the replicas on the 3 machines, which shared a currency exchange value, consistent using active replication protocol. %\medskip
\end{itemize}
%---------------------
%	PROJECT - 7
%---------------------
{\bf Simulation of Dijkstra's Algorithm} \hfill July 2010 - November 2010
\begin{itemize}
    \item Developed a program using C that would take a user-defined network graph as input and find the shortest path between any two nodes in the graph using %Dijkstra's algorithm. %\medskip
\end{itemize}
%-----------------------------
%	PRESENTATION - 1
