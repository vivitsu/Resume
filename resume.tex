\textbf{Software Development Engineer}, Amazon Web Services, Seattle, WA \hfill Jul 2016 - Present
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Transactional Services} \hfill Aug 2020 - Present
  \begin{itemize}[label=$\bullet$]
  \item The Transactional Services team builds some of the foundational distributed systems that are used by other teams within AWS and Amazon. Currently I am part of the team that builds a high-throughput, distributed, consistent, transaction log.
  \item From January-August 2022 I worked on improving the throughout of an internal streaming database service. This involved making some single-threaded components multithreaded as well as mitigating JVM memory pressure by using off-heap buffers.
  \item Between August 2020-December 2021 I worked on an internal transactional database service, improving the backup and restore times of database snapshots by switching to LZ4 compression, as well as benchmarking a new storage layout intended to improve read/write throughput as well snapshot restore times for customers with large dataset sizes.
  \end{itemize}
\item \textbf{SDKs and Tools} \hfill Jan 2018 - Jul 2020
  \begin{itemize}[label=$\bullet$]
  \item Worked on AWS' internal SDK release automation platform, which was responsible for orchestrating SDK release workflows, such as linting and validating AWS service models, release schedule management and compliance with AWS API guidelines. Apart from working on the orchestration service, I was also involved in the operational readiness and security review of the platform.
  \item Significantly improved the platform notification layer, to communicate upcoming launch deadlines, reviewer churn, and enforce that launch action items are complete, e.g. testing new SDK versions before release.
  \item Improved integration with SDK build systems by building a metadata specification API, using which SDK teams can customize their build systems, e.g. specify branches related to specific service builds in SDK codegen repos, service specific configuration for individual SDKs, e.g., PowerShell, etc.
  \item Idenitified bottlenecks in our service's day-to-day operations, and contributed to goals for reducing the operational load and oncall activities for the service.
  \item Led the security and operation readiness review for our service, which includes classifying all known architectural and operational security, latency and availability risks, and coming up with a plan to mitigate them.
  \end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Amazon Workdocs} \hfill Jul 2016 - Jan 2018
  \begin{itemize}[label=$\bullet$]
    \item Designed \& implemented a web publishing pipeline for the Amazon WorkDocs product blog using the Jekyll framework - https://blog.amazonworkdocs.com/.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Software Engineer}, LendingHome, San Francisco, CA \hfill Feb 2015 - Jul 2016
\begin{itemize}
\item Designed \& implemented a framework to schedule ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines. Using this framework, we were able to improve performance of our existing pipelines by more than 100\%.
\item Developed \& maintained a web service using Tesseract to automatically perform OCR on documents that are uploaded to the platform. The OCR-ed documents are then annotated by underwriters \& auditors to speed up loan processing.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Software Engineer}, Applied Intelligence, IO Data Centers, San Francisco, CA \hfill Sep 2014 - Feb 2015
\begin{itemize}
\item Developed data processing pipelines using \textbf{Apache Pig} to analyze sensor data gathered from colocation centers.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Embedded Engineer}, Volansys Technologies, Ahmedabad, India \hfill November 2011 - July 2012
\begin{itemize}
\item Developed \& maintained a \textbf{USB 2.0 (EHCI)} driver, to allow clients on a LAN to boot using an USB to Ethenet adapter, including interfacing with the \textbf{PCI} \& \textbf{BIOS} subsystems in order to manage the host controller \textbf{state machine} \& maintain driver compatibility with adapters from multiple vendors. 
\end{itemize}
