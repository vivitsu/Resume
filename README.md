Resume
======

This repository contains the source LaTeX file for my resume & the compiled pdf of the most recent version of my resume.
It has the following directory structure:

```
/src - Contains the LaTeX source for the resume
/pdf - Contains the most recent pdf version of the resume
README.md - This README file
```

Motivation
----------

After years of trying to typeset a decent resume in Word (and failing miserably), I finally decided to migrate
my resume to LaTeX, both because it is vastly more powerful and flexible and also because it sounds way cooler
if I tell people I have formatted my resume in LaTeX, rather than Word. See also [this](http://stevehanov.ca/blog/resume_comic.png).

It was also a fun way to learn some LaTeX skills.

Why Version Control?
--------------------

I decided to put the source file in version control so that I can track the changes to my resume over the years. 

[This](http://www.toofishes.net/blog/why-i-do-my-resume-latex/) article explains in a very good way why I decided
to put my resume in version control, and why I decided to do it in LaTeX.
