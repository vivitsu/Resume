Education
---------

* Master of Science, Electrical & Computer Engineering, May 2014 
  University of Florida, Gainesville, FL
  GPA: 3.33/4.00
  
* Bachelor of Engineering, Electronics & Communication, May 2011
  Dharmsinh Desai University, Nadiad, India

Work Experience
---------------

* Research Volunteer, May 2013 - May 2014
  Advanced Computing & Information Systems Lab, University of Florida
  
  - Set up and administered Hadoop & Riak as NoSQL datastores for storing and processing hierarchical data.
  - Designed a data model for Riak to perform clustering & tokenization of records.
  - Developed middleware in Java to fetch JSON objects from a server using HTTP calls & transform them to POJOs    (Plain Old Java Objects). The middleware also functions as an interface to the Riak cluster.
  - Evaluated the setup by benchmarking various parameters of the middleware like object fetch time, time to commit    object to cluster & JSON parsing time.

* Embedded Engineer, Nov 2011 - July 2012
  Volansys Technologies, Ahmedabad, India
 
  - Developed & maintained a USB 2.0 (EHCI) driver, to allow clients on a LAN to boot using an USB to Ethenet adapter.
  - Developed components to interface with the PCI & BIOS subsystems in order to manage the complete state machine of 
    the host controller & maintain driver compatibility with adapters from multiple vendors.
  - Developed a network driver in C to allow multiple broadcast domains in a router to form a VLAN (Virtual LAN).

Projects
--------

* Performance Evaluation of Open vSwitch & Linux Bridge, April 2014
  
  - Performed a comprehensive evaluation of Linux Bridge & Open vSwitch software bridges
    in multiple configurations.
  
  - Designed tests to measure throughput, latency and packet loss between networks of
    virtual machines.

* Distributed File System using Java, August 2013 - December 2013

  - Designed & implemented a distributed filesystem with a peer-to-peer architecture & chunk based object storage.

  - Developed software daemons to detect & react to node failures (fault-tolerance) & ensure data consistency.

  - Developed a multi-threaded client application to communicate with the cluster and store data on the filesystem.

* Performance Evaluation of Information Retrieval Systems using Java, November 2013
  - Benchmarked the indexing time, compression ratio, recall & indexing algorithm of an Apache Solr retrieval system.

  - Designed a schema to perform spelling corrections and clustering of records using Lucene’s Tokenizers & Analyzers.
 
  - Developed an application in Java to automate the record indexing process.

* Web Server for Location Based Applications using Go & Redis, April 2013
  
  - Designed and implemented a multi-threaded HTTP server that serves webpages based on a user’s GPS co-ordinates.

  - Scaled the server to serve 10,000 HTTP requests per second using goroutines.

  - Developed a multi-threaded client simulator which makes multiple HTTP requests to the server using goroutines.

* Distributed Fault-Tolerant Stock Exchange System using Java & JGroups, April 2013

  - Implemented a stock exchange system using Java & JGroups that uses fault-tolerant, 
    virtually synchronous replicas to perform stock trades.

  - The system was designed to handle large number of client connections & trade 
    requests to different nodes in the system.

  - Client information, trade requests & stock data are preserved by the system.

* Distributed Control of Currency Exchange Value using Java, March 2013

  - Implemented totally-ordered multicasting using Lamports logical clocks. The 
    goal was to keep the replicas on the 3 machines, which shared a currency exchange value, 
    consistent using active replication protocol. Used Java multi-threading and socket programming APIs.

* DNS Server using Java RMI, February 2013

  - Implemented a DNS server that supports recursive as well as iterative name 
    resolution with support for server side caching using Java RMI.

* Topology Management in Peer-to-Peer Systems, January 2013

  - Implemented the T-Man gossip based topology management protocol for peer to 
    peer overlay networks using C, which achieved various topologies for a cluster 
    of nodes based on different distance functions.

  - Modified the T-Man implementation so that it would adapt it's topology at runtime
    to changes in the radius of the network. This implementation was done in Java.
