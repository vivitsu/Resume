Work Experience
---------------

* Advanced Computing & Information Systems Lab, University of Florida
  Research Volunteer, May 2013 - Present
  
  - Set up and administered Solr, Hadoop and Riak clusters as part of a project 
    to benchmark information retrieval systems. As part of the Solr setup, created 
    a Solr schema to specify biological specimen records.

  - Developed a Java application to store the specimen records in Solr and Riak, 
    using the solrj and riak-java-client client libraries.

  - Designed the application to fetch and parse JSON specimen records from a web service, 
    convert the JSON to POJO/SolrDocument, upload it to the Riak/Solr setup and benchmark 
    each step of the process.

  - Evaluated an Apache Solr system by benchmarking various parameters like indexing time, 
    compression ratio, recall and the performance of the indexing algorithm.

* Volansys Technologies, Ahmedabad, India
  Embedded Engineer, Nov 2011 - July 2012
  
  - Developed, tested, documented and maintained a USB 2.0 (Enhanced Host Controller Interface) 
    Host Controller driver, as part of an application which allowed clients to 
    PXE (Pre-boot eXecution Environment) boot via a network using an USB to Ethenet adapter.
 
  - Enhanced the driver to manage the complete state machine of the controller 
    including device detection, power management and data transfer.

  - Developed a software feature in C that would allow multiple broadcast domains in a wireless 
    router to form a VLAN (Virtual LAN). Assessed, developed and delivered new feature requests 
    from the client for the router operating system.
 
  - Designed and executed test cases for topology setup, DHCP communication and VLAN tag 
    management in the router's operating system.

Projects
--------

* Performance Evaluation of Open vSwitch & Linux Bridge, April 2014
  
  - Performed a comprehensive evaluation of Linux Bridge & Open vSwitch software bridges
    in multiple configurations.
  
  - Designed tests to measure throughput, latency and packet loss between networks of
    virtual machines.

* Distributed File System using Java, August 2013 - December 2013

  - Designed and implemented a distributed, decentralized file system based on a 
    peer-to-peer architecture

  - Implemented modular network management, file management and cluster management 
    daemons to ensure consistency and fault-tolerance

  - Designed and implemented a multi-threaded client module and application that 
    communicates with the file system and stores data on the cluster

* Web Server for Location Based Applications, February 2013 - April 2013
  
  - Designed and implemented a secure web application that allows a user to view 
    different resources on the web about his location. User account details, 
    location history & a POI database were managed in Redis.

  - Project source code can be found at https://bitbucket.org/vivitsu/goserve.

* Distributed Fault-Tolerant Stock Exchange System, April 2013

  - Implemented a stock exchange system using Java & JGroups that used fault-tolerant, 
    virtually synchronous replicas to perform stock trades.

  - The system was designed to handle large number of client connections & trade 
    requests to different nodes in the system.

  - Client information, trade requests & stock data are preserved by the system.

* Distributed Control of Currency Exchange Value, March 2013

  - Implemented totally-ordered multicasting using Lamports logical clocks. The 
    goal was to keep the replicas on the 3 machines, which shared a currency exchange value, 
    consistent using active replication protocol. Used Java multi-threading and socket programming APIs.

* DNS Server using Java RMI, February 2013

  - Implemented a DNS server that supports recursive as well as iterative name 
    resolution with support for server side caching using Java RMI.

* Topology Management in Peer-to-Peer Systems, January 2013

  - Implemented the T-Man gossip based topology management protocol for peer to 
    peer overlay networks using C, which achieved various topologies for a cluster 
    of nodes based on different distance functions.

  - Modified the T-Man implementation so that it would adapt it's topology at runtime
    to changes in the radius of the network. This implementation was done in Java.
